= Refactor into ship object
- Game over screen at 0 lives
- Add sprites
- Platform-independent forking for omniwatcher
- Get HAML/SASS/Coffeescript integrated with Node.js (or other framework) for game
  - Make sure that files can be required
- Deploy on Heroku


Open questions:
- why does passing canvas in to ship work but passing bullets does not?
